# Grades prediction
This is a program which predict grades.

## How it works
Open the `grades.csv` file in libre office, or excel, add the subject in a new line, and add the note you think you'll have in the `Estimated grade` column. Save the file in csv, and run the program !
Now, you'll see 3 grades, estimated by the bot (a max, a min and a mean grade).
I'm developing a plotting file, which will help me improving grades prediction (see the development branch).

## Requirements :
- pandas
`pip install pandas`

(for the plotting)
- mat plot lib
`pip install matplotlib`
